                The 50/30/20 rule is a simple yet effective budgeting framework that helps individuals manage their money by dividing after-tax income into three clear categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. The needs category covers essential expenses required for basic living, such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, and minimum loan payments. The wants category includes discretionary spending that improves quality of life, like dining out, entertainment, travel, hobbies, and non-essential shopping. The final 20% is allocated toward building financial securityâ€”this includes saving for emergencies, retirement accounts, investments, and paying down debt beyond the minimums. By following this method, people can maintain a balanced approach to spending and saving, avoid overextending themselves financially, and steadily work toward long-term goals. While the percentages can be adjusted to suit personal circumstances, the 50/30/20 rule serves as a flexible guideline for creating sustainable financial habits without feeling overly restrictive.
